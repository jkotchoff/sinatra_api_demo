# Sinatra JSON API demo

This demo is just an an example Sinatra ditty to test infinite scrolling in user interface tables and lists

It has three url's available to poll:

https://sinatra-api-demo.herokuapp.com/endpoint.json?page=1

https://sinatra-api-demo.herokuapp.com/endpoint.json?page=2

and

https://sinatra-api-demo.herokuapp.com/endpoint.json?page=3

Note: You may need to copy and paste these url's into your browser to test them instead of clicking on the above links. Something is being clever and interpreting requests that link through from github as 'Forbidden' (WARN -- : attack prevented by Rack::Protection::JsonCsrf)
